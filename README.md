# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview
The goal of this analysis was to project the number of employees of the company Pewlett-Hackard who might be retiring soon. This analysis helped the company know the number of retirement packages they might offer to the retiring employees, also identifying the positions that will be necessary occupied.  At the end of the project, two more analysis requirements arose from the manager's office to determine the number of retirement employees per title and identify employees eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
